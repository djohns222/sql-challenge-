# sql-challenge

Challenge broken up into three files:

The first is the ERD JPG providing a visual representation of relationships between each of our excel tables of data
The second file is our exported code from our ERD. This file contains a detailed outline of our primary and foreign keys for each table, data types, and instructions to create specific tables and columns.
The third and final file is the Data Query searches. After importing all excel data into our created tables, there is detailed code that returns all of our prompted queries.
